  <h2>DevGarden 3.0</h2>
  <p>DevGarden 3.0 is a TRIPLE BETTER version than version 2.0 <br><br><br>

It contains better collisions, more items, easier to control items, and many other improvements.
And best of all, it's the first public release of DevGarden.
<br><br><br>
It is a plugin for Godot that turns those TROUBLE AND COMPLICATED script functions into OBJECTS THAT ARE CONTROLLED BY VARIABLES. Very rarely will you have to touch the code.
<br><br><br>
The only drawback is GDScript 2.0, which was released in the middle of the project, and it would be very difficult to migrate everything at the cost of various complicated and unsolvable bugs.<br><br><br> That's why we worked on the DevGarden 3.5 project, an almost scratch project for GDScript 2.0.
<br><br><br>

If you want to support, it would be good if you leave your comments on github and remember: the team is not just the developers and me, you are the most important part of the team.</p>
