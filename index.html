  <h3>Welcome to the</h3>
  <h1>SDKGarden Project</h1>
  <h2> NEWS </h2>
  <h4> Bad New: In this week, there isn't a DevGarden Update </h4>
  <p> But why?: I say you: </p>
  <p> When I was developing an easter egg of the "Test" level, my pc shut down when I was compiling (I didn't have it on battery), causing the project to not save correctly and to get corrupted...

When I turned it back on, the "Test" scene didn't open, I thought it was a mistake and I tried to open it on my own, but... it didn't open.

I executed it and it opened satisfactorily but it closed when the scene started

Create a new scene and try to put "Test" as a child of the node but, no.

I looked at the debugger and OH SURPRISE, 2487 Errors (I'm not exaggerating, really). I don't quite understand your translation or your error code but I think it was that it didn't load the assets and it corrupted everything

Then restart everything, even my pc, but no. I created a new project and the same thing came out, I deleted the "Test" node, I made some changes and OH SURPRISE, I was able to run everything fine, I created a new scene and everything as saved.

I still don't know what happened but it wasn't really like that, all the settings and part of the scripts were corrupted

I will last a long time correcting everything AND MORE that I will take care of myself much more

Today (04/08/2023) at 3:00 PM (Colombian time) I will give the first RELEASE of the SDK in the form of a plugin for godot

I will also take the opportunity to polish bugs, put images in the classes and translate the SDK into Spanish (I speak Spanish and everything in English is translated by Google translator)

  <h2>DevGarden 3.0</h2>
  <p>DevGarden 3.0 is a TRIPLE BETTER version than version 2.0 <br><br><br>

It contains better collisions, more items, easier to control items, and many other improvements.
And best of all, it's the first public release of DevGarden.
<br><br><br>
It is a plugin for Godot that turns those TROUBLE AND COMPLICATED script functions into OBJECTS THAT ARE CONTROLLED BY VARIABLES. Very rarely will you have to touch the code.
<br><br><br>
The only drawback is GDScript 2.0, which was released in the middle of the project, and it would be very difficult to migrate everything at the cost of various complicated and unsolvable bugs.<br><br><br> That's why we worked on the DevGarden 3.5 project, an almost scratch project for GDScript 2.0.
<br><br><br>

If you want to support, it would be good if you leave your comments on github and remember: the team is not just the developers and me, you are the most important part of the team.</p>
